Models
Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a linear model that estimates probabilities for classification tasks. It is suitable for both binary and multiclass classification problems.
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that works by finding the hyperplane that best separates different classes. It can handle both linear and non-linear data.
XGBoost

XGBoost is an efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting. It is known for its high performance and accuracy in classification tasks.

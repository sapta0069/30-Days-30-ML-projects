Spam vs. Ham Email Classification
ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This project aims to classify emails as either spam (unwanted/unsolicited emails) or ham (legitimate emails) using machine learning algorithms. By leveraging text processing techniques and classification models, the system can efficiently filter out spam, enhancing email security and user experience.
ðŸ§  Problem Statement

Spam emails pose significant threats, including phishing, scams, and cluttering of inboxes. This project provides a solution by developing a model that accurately distinguishes spam emails from ham, reducing the manual effort required to filter emails.

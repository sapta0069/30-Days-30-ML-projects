Rock vs Mine Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project to classify whether an object is a rock or a mine using sonar data. The model is built using Logistic Regression and aims to accurately distinguish between rocks and mines based on the features extracted from sonar signals.
Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to develop a binary classifier that can predict whether the object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine (metal cylinder). The dataset used for this task contains 60 frequency attributes for each object.
